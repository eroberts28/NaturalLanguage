# Natural Language

### What is Natural Language? 

This is when the interaction style is more personal. The language used is more informal and presented in a conversational way rather than just short demands. It gives the effect that you're interactive with a person rather than a computer giving you orders. 

The process of this demonstrates someone typing in a phrase or sentance that the computer comprehends and understands and therfore replies more conversational and friendly.
